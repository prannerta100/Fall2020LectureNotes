#research scientist work life balance better than academia? How mathematical can you get? Or it is just GLM?

#post doc vs direct try on industry 

1. communicating if outside the field, perspective
2. non-AI jobs: defence, finance, renewable energy
3. networking Linkedin, professors
4. convincing advisor to modify datasets/ research problem
5. product manager angle, could try for those roles too not just scientist jobs
6. academia vs industry: no handholding in industry, important to fail fast in both academia and industry
7. Don't aim for a perfect thesis, focus on skill building too
