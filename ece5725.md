1. Lutron Linux microcontrollers in light switches

## Lecture 2, 9/4
1. SpaceX Linux microcontrollers, 3 to make sure others take over if the first one fails, they check on each other by comparing outputs of simple commands

## Lab 1 + HW 1

1. Format SD card to FAT32
2. Use `balenaEtcher` to etch Raspbian Buster on to SD card
3. Create file `ssh` with one space and a file 
3. Create backup via Win32 Disk Imager (as and when needed)
4. Insert SD card into the Pi, hook up to power, ehternet cable connection to laptop (easiest, but could also remotely connect to Pi)
5. raspi-config to change hostname, locale, etc.
6. `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get full-upgrade`
7. If Wifi not working, use `wpa_supplicant.conf`
8. Install piTFT by using scripts, change `/boot/config.txt`, some other files need to be changed too
