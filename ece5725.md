# ECE 5725 Fall 2020 Lecture Notes

## Lecture 1, 9/2
1. Lutron Linux microcontrollers in light switches

## Lecture 2, 9/4
1. SpaceX Linux microcontrollers, 3 to make sure others take over if the first one fails, they check on each other by comparing outputs of simple commands
2. 

## Lecture 3, 9/7

## Lecture 4, 9/9

## Lecture 5, 9/11

## Lecture 6, 9/14

## Lecture 7, 9/16
1.
2.
3.

## Lecture 8, 9/18
1. VNC viewer might throw an error when you type `startx`. Solution is to change to "boot to desktop" 
2. Don't do `sudo startx`, it could mess up the Linux files
3. FIFO, Sockets, pipe

## Lecture 8, 9/21
1. FIFO is a named pipe. Usual pipe `|` is temporary, never stored
2. P1 P2 2 processes `P1 > fifo`. P2 can read the fifo.
3. `su - jfs9`: `-` means restore it to how it was
4. `whoami` to find out what your user id is
5. `subprocess.check_output('cmd_string', shell=True)` in Python to run a command
6.  GPIO pins (make sure white line aligns with piTFT buttons)
7. Older RPi modules had 26 pins, new ones have 40 pins
8. Green pins: typically no secondary functions
9. GREEN = Serial Rx+Tx, or UART (Universally Asynchronous Rx and Tx)
10. LIGHT BLUE = i2C, SDA and SCL, camera
11. PURPLE = SPI, SPI1 used by piTFT
12. BLACK = Ground
13. 6 SPI channels
14. SPI channels overlap with i2C channels, can't use 6 SPI and 6 i2C
15. 3.3 V on each RPi, 16 mA max from any output, don't power other devices through RPi, it can't provide too much current
16. ``` import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
GPIO.setup(26, GPIO.IN...```


## Lab 1 + HW 1

1. Format SD card to FAT32
2. Use `balenaEtcher` to etch Raspbian Buster on to SD card
3. Create file `ssh` with one space and a file 
3. Create backup via Win32 Disk Imager (as and when needed)
4. Insert SD card into the Pi, hook up to power, ehternet cable connection to laptop (easiest, but could also remotely connect to Pi)
5. raspi-config to change hostname, locale, etc.
6. `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get full-upgrade`
7. If Wifi not working, use `wpa_supplicant.conf`
8. Install piTFT by using scripts, change `/boot/config.txt`, some other files need to be changed too
