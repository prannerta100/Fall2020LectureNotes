# ECE 5725 Fall 2020 Lecture Notes

## Lecture 1, 9/2
1. Lutron Linux microcontrollers in light switches

## Lecture 2, 9/4
1. SpaceX Linux microcontrollers, 3 to make sure others take over if the first one fails, they check on each other by comparing outputs of simple commands
2. 

## Lecture 3, 9/7

## Lecture 4, 9/9

## Lecture 5, 9/11

## Lecture 6, 9/14

## Lecture 7, 9/16
1.
2.
3.

## Lecture 8, 9/18
1. VNC viewer might throw an error when you type `startx`. Solution is to change to "boot to desktop" 
2. Don't do `sudo startx`, it could mess up the Linux files
3. FIFO, Sockets, pipe

## Lecture 9, 9/21
1. FIFO is a named pipe. Usual pipe `|` is temporary, never stored
2. P1 P2 2 processes `P1 > fifo`. P2 can read the fifo.
3. `su - jfs9`: `-` means restore it to how it was
4. `whoami` to find out what your user id is
5. `subprocess.check_output('cmd_string', shell=True)` in Python to run a command
6.  GPIO pins (make sure white line aligns with piTFT buttons)
7. Older RPi modules had 26 pins, new ones have 40 pins
8. Green pins: typically no secondary functions
9. GREEN = Serial Rx+Tx, or UART (Universally Asynchronous Rx and Tx)
10. LIGHT BLUE = i2C, SDA and SCL, camera
11. PURPLE = SPI, SPI1 used by piTFT
12. BLACK = Ground
13. 6 SPI channels
14. SPI channels overlap with i2C channels, can't use 6 SPI and 6 i2C
15. 3.3 V on each RPi, 16 mA max from any output, don't power other devices through RPi, it can't provide too much current
16. ``` 
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM) #set up for broadcom numbering not board numbering
GPIO.setup(26, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_UP)
while True:
	....
```

See diagrams
## Lecture 10, 9/23
1. Debug mplayer fifo with simple commands like `echo "PAUSE" > video_fifo`
2. Creating video_fifo is necessary: otherwise if you write "quit" in your fifo, mplayer will read it, quit and never start again
3. In start_video.py, if you write 
```
video_control.py &
mplayer &
```
then you are missing something (?)
4. Use a current limiting resistor (1k resistor) when using GPIO as input, b/c if someone sets it up as output then you are not sending too much current..
5. This resistor available internally in the Pi too (value 50 k)
6. Internal resistor dangerous in production setting: someone could reset your GPIO.setup
7. Use pull up when xx and pull down when xxx

## Lecture 11, 9/25
1. `-framedrop` tells mplayer to drop frames if they don't come right
2. Multiple button hits if time delay close to 0, if multiple python guys running in the background, if funny mechanical/electrical stuff in the piTFT button
3. User Datagram Protocol and Network Time Protocol to communicate to an atomic clock and get the time up to a few ms
4. Pi got rid of ntp daemon a couple of cycles ago, replaced it with timesyncd (a little less flexible), does the same thing. Timesyncd daemon exists in the Pi, takes care of time sync.
5. SDL: simple direct media layer
6. pygame interface better than SDL: but need to do some Linux kernel surgery
7. 	Need to downgrade to Wheezy from Buster (~4 iterations down) to make pygame work 
8. RECT is the bounding box for an object you draw in pygame, SURFACE is the canvas
9. `os.putenv('SDL_VIDEODRIVER','fbcon')`, `os.putenv('SDL_FBDEV','/dev/fb1')` before `pygame.init()`
10. `blit` in pygame combines 2 surfaces, `flip` sends surface stuff to the (piTFT) screen 

## Lecture 12, 9/28

## Lecture 13, 9/30
1. GPIO.callback functions like independent threads for each button
2. GPIO bounce time neglects multiple button presses within the same interval, there is bounce in these cheap membrane switches
3. If you do 
```
which interrupt:
	if 19:
		do xxx
	if 26:
		do xxx
```
you are losing the independent control of 2 callbacks, so best to use multiple callback routines, one thread for each button
4. Data integrity: if you don't use locks then clash
5. swapping between threads takes some time, different threads are schedules 
6. different callbacks are accessed serially (first come first), so your callback functions shouldn't run heavy code, because other buttons won't be attended to until the loop is over.

## Lecture 14, 10/2



## Lecture 15, 10/5
1.` myscreen.fill(0,0,0)` to clear screen, `myscreen.blit(my_image, my_image_rect)` to blit and `pygame.display.flip()` to slip on the screen: 3 most important commands in pygame2. 

## Lecture 16, 10/7
1. There could be touch failures, e.g., weird coordinates on piTFT but OK on the monitor. There is a `fix touchscreen` script. The monitor has a different driver than the piTFT.
2. Might have to reboot, bad environment variables
3. 

## Lecture 17, 10/9
1. Spark motor good not power hungry
2. DC motor spins fast, cheap
3. Lab 3 single 6 V battery powers Pi (3.3 V), 6 V motor voltage, motor controller 5 VNC
4. Motor controller
5. Don't forget 1k resistors
6. Motor controller can drive 2 motors (A, B)
6. Motor controller has a standby pin, VCC (5V supply), input for direction (AIN 1, 2) , input for speed (PWMA,B), 
7. AIN 1,2 BIN 1,2 why 2 inputs needed? Weird logic table (LL,LH,HL,HH 4 entries)
8. PWM input, you need to specify frequency, duty cycle (fraction of time high) to determine the PWM sequence
9. Like servo, 50 Hz works good
10. Full speed (50 Hz, 100) (specify duty cycle in percentage, not fraction!)
11. LED good debugging tool

## Lecture 18, 10/12
1. RTOS need to meet the deadline, must be fast
2. $T_A$ time of arrival, $T_S$ start time, $T_F$ finish time, $T_D$ deadline
3. Hard real time: hard real time systems: aeroplane, car, SpaceX; no result by deadline means you are doomed
4. Firm real time: `framedrop`, where if I don't get frame 40 let's say, you just throw it away and proceed
5. Soft real time: penalty for being late, but no worries if you miss it (like Google Maps taking too much to respond)

## Lecture 19, 10/14

## Lecture 20, 10/16
1. `piscope` great tool, part of pigpio, helps us monitor GPIO pins. Why did the 2 
2. RTOS: Timeliness, preditability, efficiency, robustness, fault tolerance, maintainability
3. Linux round robin process scheduler: if 4 processes, then process 1 little time, process 2 little time and so on, then process 1 again, go on till all processes are over.
4. Higher priority processes take over resources, not good if we have deadlines in an RTOS system!
5. deadlocks can happen, i.e., process 1 locks a var the other can't unlock it
6. Priority inversion: bad locks can cause low priority processes to overtake
7. 

## Lecture 21, 10/19
1. Interrupts if all of them left on 
2. Cache is good for multiprocessing but bad for real time, in real time we need a good estimate of the time taken, even if this means loss of speed
3. In an aeroplace using polling loop not good
4. virtual memory can be bigger than the RAM, memory pages of the virtual memory stored on the SD card
5. page fault can happen when the process can't run because it is not present in the physical memory (?)
6. page fault bad for RTOS
7. 5 clock cycles to 1 clock cycle (how?) you need to predict branches at each instruction in the pipeline, if prediction wrong then pipeline flush
8. embedded system versus real time system
9. Linux helps if we need to run multiple tasks, more complicated than a special purpose microcontroller
10. ssh, ntp, timesyncd mature tools for handling, Linux advantages outweigh the disadvantages

## Lab 1 + HW 1

1. Format SD card to `FAT32`
2. Use `balenaEtcher` to etch Raspbian Buster on to SD card
3. Create file `ssh` with one space and a file 
3. Create backup via Win32 Disk Imager (as and when needed)
4. Insert SD card into the Pi, hook up to power, ehternet cable connection to laptop (easiest, but could also remotely connect to Pi)
5. raspi-config to change hostname, locale, etc.
6. `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get full-upgrade`
7. If Wifi not working, use `wpa_supplicant.conf`
8. Install piTFT by using scripts, change `/boot/config.txt`, some other files need to be changed too
9. To run the bunny video, type `sudo SDL_VIDEODRIVER=fbcon SDL_FBDEV=/dev/fb0 mplayer -vo sdl -framedrop bigbuckbunny320p.mp4`. 
10. Mplayer controls:
```
 <-  or  ->       seek backward/forward 10 seconds
 down or up       seek backward/forward  1 minute
 pgdown or pgup   seek backward/forward 10 minutes
 < or >           step backward/forward in playlist
 p or SPACE       pause movie (press any key to continue)
 q or ESC         stop playing and quit program
 + or -           adjust audio delay by +/- 0.1 second
 o                cycle OSD mode:  none / seekbar / seekbar + timer
 * or /           increase or decrease PCM volume
 x or z           adjust subtitle delay by +/- 0.1 second
 r or t           adjust subtitle position up/down, also see -vf expand
```
11. Choose 4 out of these commands to create your `control panel`.
12. To fast forward or rewind, use commands such as `seek + (or -) 10` to echo into the fifo
13. Change screen resolutions and raspi-config `boot to desktop option` to make VNC working
14. Downgrade to wheezy to make touch on piTFT work



## Lab 2 + HW 2

1. Two_collide.py is the goal
2. Can add more external buttons, look at the chart for available GPIO pins
3. touchscreen was not being detected, reboot fixed it. Maybe trying to make VNC work screwed things up?
4. General talk with Prof. : embedded Linux taking over, Linux means all your devices are connected, can ssh and so on, stable OS, don't need knickknacks as in microcontroller board
5. Revolution taking place, ARM processors as capable as a laptop now
6. Coral accelerator from Google to do heavy duty ML

## Lab 3 + HW 3
1. While the GPIO pins can provide lots of useful control and sensing ability to the
Raspberry Pi, it is important to remember they are wired directly into the internal core of
the system. This means that they provide a very easy way to introduce bad voltages and
currents directly into the ARM chip on the Raspberry Pi (this is not good and means it is
easy to break it without exercising a little care).
2. Need to switch the standby pin to high
